# Star Wars API Microserviceï¿½ðŸš€

This project has been created to implement a basic microservices platform.

Following the microservices architecture, it provides the functionality to create, find, update, or delete information about StarWars characters, planets, and movies.

It is developed based on the ExpressJS Framework, implements a MongoDB as a persistent information platform and Mongoose as an ORM to send and retrieve information from/to the database.

This project consists of 5 independent applications interconnected via HTTPRequests:

- Gateway as an entry point
- Characters, Movies and Planets all services ready CRUD that manages data manipulation, only accessible from the gateway.
- Database is the service that manages the connection, sending and retrieval of data from/to the database.

This project is containerized using Docker Compose. To run this project you must clone the repository and run docker-compose locally.
